This app was made by following a Mackenzie Child tutorial on Youtube. 

There is little difference between this application and the raddit app, thus the lack of excitement.

This repo was just me trying to mimic a tutorial video to get the hang of creating a rails application and learning what CSS and HTML actually do.
